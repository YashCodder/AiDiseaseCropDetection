          <h2>Research-Based Innovation</h2>

          <p>
            Traditional crop disease detection methods rely heavily on manual inspection, 
            which often leads to delayed identification. Our system leverages deep learning 
            and IoT sensors to detect diseases even before visible symptoms appear.
          </p>

          <p>
            By combining CNN-based image classification with LSTM-based predictive models, 
            the system can forecast disease outbreaks up to 21 days in advance, helping 
            farmers take preventive actions early.

          <p>
            Field trials across multiple regions have shown significant improvements in crop 
            yield, reduction in pesticide usage, and better resource management, making this 
            solution highly effective for sustainable agriculture.
